This neovim configuration uses [lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)!
Before using lazyvim I had a great time with my neovim configuration. However, I
could never get my startup time below several seconds and my LSP integration
was not great.

Lazyvim handles both of those so much better with amazing LSP setup and
startup time values of:

- Windows -> 200ms
- Linux -> 20ms
